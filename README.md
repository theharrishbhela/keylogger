# keylogger 
An insidous form of spyware also known as a Keylogger. You enter sensitive data from your keyboard, privately thinking no one is watching. However, keylogging software is tracking every keystroke and sentence your pretty little fingers can type.

Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers you type, the webpages you visit â€“ all by logging your keyboard strokes. The software is installed on your computer, and records everything you type. Then it sends this log file to a server, where cybercriminals wait to make use of all this sensitive information.

In this project, i've made a keylogger. That captures keystrokes and saves them in a "logger.txt" file.
